name: deploy
description: Run and deploy a Pyjoyment application. Use for its servers (daemon, prefork, prethread, the zero downtime of pyjo-hot, pyjo-reload in development), their options and PYJO_* variables, reverse proxies and TLS, graceful stops and the Health plugin for probes, and the generators of a pyproject.toml, a Dockerfile, the manifests of Kubernetes and the ZIP files of AWS Lambda, and WSGI, ASGI and FastCGI servers in front of it.

# Deployment

An application of Pyjoyment serves HTTP and WebSockets with its own servers,
which its commands start, `python app.py daemon` or `python -m MyApp
prefork`. An option of a server has a variable of its own, `PYJO_` and its
name, as `PYJO_WORKERS` for `--workers`, so the environment of a container
configures it without its command line. The generators write the files of a
deployment for the application: `pyproject.toml`, a `Dockerfile`, the
manifests of Kubernetes, and the ZIP files of AWS Lambda.

## The application

```python
# app.py
import os

from Pyjoyment.Lite import *


# The secret of the sessions from the environment of the deployment, not from the code
app.secrets = [os.environ.get('APP_SECRET', 'Change this secret')]

# /livez and /healthz while the server answers, /readyz once the checks pass, for the probes of an orchestrator
ready = {'db': True}
plugin('Health', checks={'db': lambda c: ready['db']})


@get('/')
def index(c):
    c.render(text=f'Hello from {app.mode}')


app.start()
```

## Servers

```sh
pyjo-reload app.py                                 # development, restarts when the files change
python app.py daemon -l 'http://*:8080'            # one process
python app.py prefork -w 8 -l 'http://*:8080'      # eight worker processes, for code that blocks too
python app.py prethread -w 8                       # eight worker threads, on every core with a free-threaded Python
pyjo-hot app.py                                    # prefork, which HUP replaces with zero downtime
PYJO_MODE=production PYJO_WORKERS=8 PYJO_LISTEN='http://*:8080' python app.py prefork
python app.py prefork -p -l 'http://127.0.0.1:8080'           # behind a reverse proxy, X-Forwarded-For
python app.py daemon -l 'https://*:443?cert=./server.crt&key=./server.key'
```

- `-m production` or `PYJO_MODE=production` hides the details of the
  exception pages, and a plugin of configuration reads `myapp.production.yml`; `PORT` of a platform, as
  Cloud Run or Knative, is the port when `-l` and `PYJO_LISTEN` are not given.
- INT and TERM stop gracefully, waiting for the requests in progress up to
  `--graceful-timeout` (25 seconds), and `--shutdown-delay` (`PYJO_SHUTDOWN_DELAY`)
  keeps serving with a failing `/readyz` before, so that a load balancer moves
  away first; QUIT stops at once, and HUP restarts the workers of `prefork`.
- `-c` limits the connections of a worker, `-c 1` serves one request at a
  time, for an application whose code blocks.

## Containers, Kubernetes and AWS Lambda

```sh
python app.py generate pyproject                   # the project of uv, with the dependencies of the script
python app.py generate dockerfile -p 8080          # Dockerfile and .dockerignore, prefork with a HEALTHCHECK of /livez
python app.py generate kubernetes -i myapp         # kubernetes/base, dev and prod for Kustomize
python app.py generate lambda-zip                  # the ZIP files of a function and of its layers
docker build -t myapp . && docker run -p 8080:8080 myapp
kubectl apply -k kubernetes/prod
```

- The `Dockerfile` runs `prefork` on `PORT`, with a `HEALTHCHECK` of
  `/livez`; `--graceful-timeout` and `--user` adjust it, and `--target lambda`
  makes an image of AWS Lambda.
- `kubernetes/dev` runs the files of the project from a ConfigMap on the image
  of uv, `kubernetes/prod` the image of `-i`, with the probes of `/livez` and
  `/readyz` and the graceful stop of the pods.
- On AWS Lambda the script ends with `handler = app.start()`: the runtime of
  Python calls `app.handler`, and a custom runtime runs the script itself.

## WSGI, ASGI and FastCGI servers

```sh
PYJO_WSGI=1 gunicorn app:application               # the script ends with application = app.start()
PYJO_ASGI=1 uvicorn app:application
PYJO_LISTEN='fcgi://127.0.0.1:9000' python app.py daemon    # FastCGI behind nginx or Caddy
```

- Through WSGI the event loop serves one request at a time of each worker of
  the server, and WebSockets need the servers of Pyjoyment or ASGI.

## Mistakes

- `daemon` in production serves with one process, without restarting a
  worker that stops; `prefork` restarts its workers.
- `app.secrets` committed with the code signs the cookies of every
  deployment: take it from the environment or the configuration.
- `/readyz` with the checks of a database in the liveness probe restarts the
  containers when the database is down: liveness is `/livez`.
- A blocking request handler under `daemon` blocks every connection: more
  workers of `prefork`, `-c 1`, or code that does not block.
