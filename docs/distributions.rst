Distributions
=============

Pyjoyment needs nothing besides the Python standard library, so what needs
another library is a distribution of its own, and so is what follows a
specification that is revised more often than Pyjoyment is released. A
distribution adds a module to a namespace of Pyjoyment, as ``Pyjo.Reactor``
for a reactor, ``Pyjoyment.Plugin`` for a plugin or ``Pyjo`` for a protocol.
They are installed from their Git repositories until they are on PyPI.

Reactors
--------

A reactor runs the I/O and the timers of :mod:`Pyjo.IOLoop` on another event
loop, which ``PYJO_REACTOR`` selects before :mod:`Pyjo.IOLoop` is loaded. Its
API is the one of :mod:`Pyjo.Reactor`, which :mod:`Pyjo.IOLoop` calls, so an
application uses it through :mod:`Pyjo.IOLoop`, as it uses
:mod:`Pyjo.Reactor.Asyncio` and :mod:`Pyjo.Reactor.Poll`, and needs nothing
of its own for it. A reactor passes the whole test suite of Pyjoyment.

Protocols
---------

A protocol is a package of the namespace ``Pyjo``, with a server and a client
made with Pyjoyment: a route of an application of :mod:`Pyjoyment` and the user
agent of :mod:`Pyjo.UserAgent`.
