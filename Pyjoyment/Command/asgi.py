"""
Pyjoyment.Command.asgi - ASGI command
=====================================
::

    Usage: APPLICATION asgi [OPTIONS]

      application = app.start('asgi')
      PYJO_ASGI=1 uvicorn myapp:application

    Options:
      -h, --help          Show this summary of available options
          --home <path>   Path to home directory of your application, defaults to
                          the value of PYJO_HOME or auto-detection
      -m, --mode <name>   Operating mode for your application, defaults to the
                          value of PYJO_MODE or "development"

:mod:`Pyjoyment.Command.asgi` starts applications with the
:mod:`Pyjo.Server.ASGI` backend: it returns the ASGI application, which a
script keeps for the ASGI server that imports it. The script of an application
that ends with ``application = app.start()`` runs this command when the
``PYJO_ASGI`` environment variable is set, and the command of its arguments
otherwise.

This is a core command, that means it is always enabled and its code a good
example for learning to build new commands, you're welcome to fork it.

See :mod:`Pyjoyment.Commands` for a list of commands that are available by
default.
