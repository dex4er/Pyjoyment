:mod:`Pyjoyment.Command.lambda` starts applications with the
:mod:`Pyjo.Server.Lambda` backend: it returns the handler of an event
function of AWS Lambda, which a script keeps for the runtime that imports it.
The script of an application that ends with ``handler = app.start()``, as
``myapp.py`` with the handler ``myapp.handler``, runs this command in the
runtime of AWS Lambda, which has the ``AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API`` environment
variable, and the command of its arguments otherwise.

The script that runs as the main program with that variable, as the
``bootstrap`` of a custom runtime or the command of an image, is the runtime
itself: the command runs the application for the invocations of the Runtime
API with :meth:`Pyjo.Server.Lambda.Pyjo_Server_Lambda.run_runtime`, until the
process ends, where a runtime that imports the script takes its handler. ::

    #!/bin/sh
    # The bootstrap of a custom runtime, as provided.al2023
    exec python3 "$LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT/myapp.py"

This is a core command, that means it is always enabled and its code a good
example for learning to build new commands, you're welcome to fork it.

See :mod:`Pyjoyment.Commands` for a list of commands that are available by
default.
