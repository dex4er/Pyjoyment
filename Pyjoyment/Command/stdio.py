:mod:`Pyjoyment.Command.stdio` starts applications with the
:mod:`Pyjo.Server.Stdio` backend, which serves the protocol that the
application or a plugin gives with a subscriber of its event ``stream`` on
the standard input and output. It is not detected, as a pipe on the standard
input is too common to mean it.

This is a core command, that means it is always enabled and its code a good
example for learning to build new commands, you're welcome to fork it.

See :mod:`Pyjoyment.Commands` for a list of commands that are available by
default.
