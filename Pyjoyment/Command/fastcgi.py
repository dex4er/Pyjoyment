:mod:`Pyjoyment.Command.fastcgi` starts applications that a web server starts
as FastCGI applications, as Apache with ``mod_fcgid`` and lighttpd do: it
serves the listen socket that the web server gives the application as the
file descriptor ``0``, with :mod:`Pyjo.Server.Daemon` and
:mod:`Pyjo.Server.FastCGI`, and is detected by :mod:`Pyjoyment.Commands`
when the file descriptor ``0`` is such a socket. A FastCGI application that
listens on a socket of its own, which the web server connects to, is started
with the commands ``daemon`` and ``prefork`` and a listen location
``fcgi://`` or ``fcgi+unix://``.

This is a core command, that means it is always enabled and its code a good
example for learning to build new commands, you're welcome to fork it.

See :mod:`Pyjoyment.Commands` for a list of commands that are available by
default.
