Pyjoyment.Plugin.Health - Liveness and readiness plugin
=======================================================
::

    # Pyjoyment
    app.plugin('Health')

    # Pyjoyment.Lite
    plugin('Health')

    # The checks of readiness, of a function, a coroutine function or one that returns a promise
    app.plugin('Health', checks={'db': lambda c: db.ping(), 'queue': queue_ready_p}, timeout=2)

    # A check that another plugin adds
    app.health.check('cache', lambda c: cache.connected)

:mod:`Pyjoyment.Plugin.Health` answers the probes of containers and
orchestrators, as the liveness, readiness and startup probes of Kubernetes,
the probes of Cloud Run, the health checks of load balancers and the
``HEALTHCHECK`` of Docker, with the endpoints of Kubernetes itself.

``GET /livez``
    Liveness: ``200 OK`` with ``ok`` while the server answers, as a server
    whose event loop is blocked does not answer. It has no checks of the
    application, as an orchestrator restarts a container whose liveness
    fails, and a database that is down does not get up with it.

``GET /healthz``
    The same as ``/livez``, under the name of the probes of Docker and of
    load balancers.

``GET /readyz``
    Readiness: ``200 OK`` with ``ok`` once the checks of the application
    pass, and ``503 Service Unavailable`` with the list of the checks while
    one of them fails, so that an orchestrator or a load balancer sends the
    requests to another instance. The check ``shutdown`` fails from the
    moment that the server stops gracefully, as
    :attr:`Pyjo.IOLoop.Pyjo_IOLoop.is_stopping` of the event loop of the
    thread, :data:`Pyjo.IOLoop.singleton`, which is the one of every server of
    Pyjoyment, and its workers, tells: a client whose connection is kept alive
    gets ``503`` with its last response.

The checks run at the same time, each with a timeout, and a check passes
unless it raises an exception, returns ``False``, or returns a promise, a
coroutine or another awaitable that is rejected, is fulfilled with ``False``,
or does not settle within its timeout. The reason of a failure goes to the
log, as the ``warn`` message ``Health check "db" failed: ...``, not to the
response, which withholds it.

A query of ``verbose`` lists the checks on success too, ``exclude`` leaves a
check out, as many times as there are checks to leave out, and a check of its
own is under the name of the endpoint, as ``/readyz/db``, as Kubernetes has
them. ::

    $ curl 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/readyz?verbose'
    [+]shutdown ok
    [+]db ok
    readyz check passed

    $ curl 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/readyz?exclude=db'
    ok

    $ curl -i 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/readyz/db'
    HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
    ...
    [-]db failed: reason withheld
    readyz check failed

The endpoints are answered in a hook of ``around_dispatch``, before the hooks
of ``before_dispatch``, the static files and the routes, so that a probe is
cheap, is not logged but on the level ``trace``, and is answered also where a
hook rejects it, as :mod:`Pyjoyment.Plugin.AllowedHosts` would reject the
``Host`` of the address of a pod, which a probe of Kubernetes sends. A hook of
``around_dispatch`` that the application registers before the plugin wraps
the probes too.

See :mod:`Pyjoyment.Plugins` for a list of plugins that are available by
default.

Options
-------

:mod:`Pyjoyment.Plugin.Health` supports the following options.

``checks`` ::

    app.plugin('Health', checks={'db': lambda c: db.ping()})

    The checks of readiness, the names and the functions that take the
    controller of the probe, defaults to none.

``healthz`` ::

    app.plugin('Health', healthz='/health')
    app.plugin('Health', healthz=None)

    The path of the alias of liveness, defaults to ``/healthz``, ``None``
    leaves it out.

``livez`` ::

    app.plugin('Health', livez='/-/live')

    The path of liveness, defaults to ``/livez``, ``None`` leaves it out.

``readyz`` ::

    app.plugin('Health', readyz='/-/ready')

    The path of readiness, defaults to ``/readyz``, ``None`` leaves it out.

``timeout`` ::

    app.plugin('Health', timeout=0.5)

    The time in seconds that a check may take, defaults to ``1``, the
    timeout of a probe of Kubernetes.

Helpers
-------

:mod:`Pyjoyment.Plugin.Health` implements the following helpers.

``health.check`` ::

    app.health.check('db', lambda c: db.ping())
    app.health.check('search', search_ready_p, timeout=5)

    Add a check of readiness, with a timeout of its own, or replace the
    check of the name, as a plugin that connects to a service does.

``health.path`` ::

    path = c.health.path('livez')

    The path of an endpoint, ``livez``, ``readyz`` or ``healthz``, or
    ``None`` for one that is left out, as
    :mod:`Pyjoyment.Command.Author.generate.dockerfile` takes it for the
    ``HEALTHCHECK`` of the image.
