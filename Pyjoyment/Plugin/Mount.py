:mod:`Pyjoyment.Plugin.Mount` is a plugin that allows you to mount whole
:mod:`Pyjoyment` applications, other applications of :mod:`Pyjo`, ``WSGI``
applications, which :mod:`Pyjo.App.WSGI` runs, and ``ASGI`` applications,
whose ``__call__`` is a coroutine function, which :mod:`Pyjo.App.ASGI` runs,
as an application of :mod:`Pyjo` from a script, an object, or the name of a
module and its attribute, and ``FastCGI`` applications, which
:mod:`Pyjo.App.FastCGI` connects to, by their location ``fcgi://`` or
``fcgi+unix://``, and ``CGI`` programs, which :mod:`Pyjo.App.CGI` runs, as an
object of it. An application that is not one of :mod:`Pyjoyment` gets the
server that runs it with :meth:`~Pyjo.App.Pyjo_App.server` before the server
starts, as the application that mounts it does.

The path is a pattern of a route that matches the beginning of the path of a
request, as in Mojolicious, so that ``/php`` matches ``/php.css`` too, which
an application of another framework does not get, as its ``SCRIPT_NAME`` or
``root_path`` ends at a slash. A regular expression matches the whole path, as
the ones of PromQL do, with the rest of it for the application in its group
``path``.

The code of this plugin is a good example for learning to build new plugins,
you're welcome to fork it.

See :mod:`Pyjoyment.Plugins` for a list of plugins that are available by
default.
