"""
The summary of the summaries of the jobs of the workflow Tests, in Markdown, from
the JUnit XML that each job uploads as an artifact named "junit-" and the name
of the job, which download-artifact puts in a directory of the same name:

    PYTHONPATH=. python .github/scripts/test-report.py reports > report.md
    PYTHONPATH=. python .github/scripts/test-report.py reports jobs.tsv > report.md

The file of the jobs has the name and the URL of each job of the run, separated
by a tab, as the API of the jobs of a run gives them, which link the jobs.

A row for each job, with its tests that passed, were skipped and failed, the
totals, and the tests that failed, with the name of their job. It starts with a
comment that marks it, so that the comment of the pull request that has it is
found and edited, instead of a new one for each run. The time is left out, as
the one of Pyjo.Prove is the sum of the scripts, which run at the same time,
and the one of pytest is the time of the run.
