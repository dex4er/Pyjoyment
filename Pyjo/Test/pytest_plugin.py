Pyjo.Test.pytest_plugin - Pyjoyment in pytest
=============================================
::

    $ pytest
    $ pytest -v t/basic.py

    # pyproject.toml
    [tool.pytest.ini_options]
    testpaths = ["t", "tests"]
    pythonpath = ["."]

    # tests/conftest.py
    import pytest

        return 'MyApp'

:mod:`Pyjo.Test.pytest_plugin` is a plugin of `pytest <https://pytest.org>`_,
which pytest loads where Pyjoyment is installed. It runs the test scripts of
:mod:`Pyjo.Test` as :mod:`Pyjo.Prove` does, each as a test of pytest, and lets
the tests of pytest use :mod:`Pyjo.Test` and :mod:`Pyjo.Test.Pyjo`.
:mod:`Pyjo.Prove` stays the runner of the test scripts, and pytest runs the
same scripts for whoever runs ``pytest``, as a test explorer of an IDE or a
coding agent. Pyjoyment does not depend on pytest, and nothing of it but this
plugin imports pytest.

It has no counterpart in Mojolicious.

Test scripts
------------

A file with the extension ``.py`` in the directories of ``pyjo_prove_paths``,
``t`` by default, is a test script, whatever its name, but ``conftest.py``,
and pytest does not import it. The script runs in a process of its own, in the
root directory of pytest, with :func:`Pyjo.Prove.run_script`, and is a test of
pytest of its own, ``t/basic.py``, which passes, fails or is skipped as
:mod:`Pyjo.Prove` reports the script. The report of a failure shows the
failed tests, the standard error of the script with their diagnostic
messages, and what is wrong with the plan or the exit status; the whole TAP
output of the script is its captured standard output. ``Bail out!`` stops the
run.

pytest runs its tests one after another, and so the test scripts, where
:mod:`Pyjo.Prove` runs several at the same time with ``-j``; ``-n`` of
`pytest-xdist <https://pytest-xdist.readthedocs.io>`_ does so, as each test
script is a test of its own.

The scripts get the environment that pytest started with, as
``python -m Pyjo.Prove -l`` gives it to them: the root directory in
``PYTHONPATH``, ``PYJO_HARNESS_ACTIVE``, and ``PYJO_HARNESS_IS_VERBOSE`` with
``-v``.

``pytest`` without arguments runs the directories of ``testpaths``, so a
project whose tests are test scripts names their directory there, in
``pyproject.toml``, as the projects of ``generate app`` and
``generate plugin`` do: ::

    [tool.pytest.ini_options]
    testpaths = ["t"]
    pythonpath = ["."]

Tests of pytest
---------------

The plugin calls :func:`Pyjo.Test.raise_failures`, so that a failed test of
:mod:`Pyjo.Test` or of :mod:`Pyjo.Test.Pyjo` raises :exc:`AssertionError`
with its name and its diagnostic message, ``plan(skip_all=...)`` skips the
test, and ``Bail out!`` stops the run.

A test stops at its first failed test, after which
:attr:`~Pyjo.Test.Pyjo.Pyjo_Test_Pyjo.success` and
:meth:`~Pyjo.Test.Pyjo.Pyjo_Test_Pyjo.otherwise` have nothing to do. The user
agent of :mod:`Pyjo.Test.Pyjo` blocks, so a test is a function, not a
coroutine. The tests run in one process, where their applications share the
singleton of :mod:`Pyjo.IOLoop` and the environment, which a test script has
of its own. The tests go to a directory of their own, as ``tests``, as
:mod:`Pyjo.Prove` runs every script in ``t``, and ``pythonpath`` of pytest
puts the root directory in :data:`sys.path`, as ``-l`` of :mod:`Pyjo.Prove`
does for the test scripts, so that a test finds the application by the name
of its class.

Ini options
-----------

``pyjo_prove_paths``
    The directories of the test scripts, relative to the configuration file,
    ``t`` of the root directory by default. Without a directory, pytest runs
    no test scripts. ::

        [tool.pytest.ini_options]
        pyjo_prove_paths = ["t", "xt"]

``pyjo_prove_timeout``
    The most seconds a test script may run, no limit by default. A test script
    that runs longer is killed, with the processes it started, and fails. ::

        [tool.pytest.ini_options]
        pyjo_prove_timeout = "60"

Fixtures
--------

``t``
    A :mod:`Pyjo.Test.Pyjo` object of the application of the fixture ``app``,
    which the tests define, and which can be anything that
    :meth:`Pyjo.Test.Pyjo.Pyjo_Test_Pyjo.__init__` takes. The end of the
    test closes it. ::

        @pytest.fixture
        def app():
            return Pyjo.File.curfile().dirname().sibling('myapp.py')


        def test_index(t):
            t.get_ok('/').status_is(200)
