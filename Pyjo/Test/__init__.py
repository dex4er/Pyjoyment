    done_testing()

:mod:`Pyjo.Test` is a module for writing test scripts which print their results
in the `Test Anything Protocol <https://testanything.org/>`_ (TAP). It is
inspired by Perl's ``Test::More``, which the tests of Mojolicious are written
with, but it is not a port of it.

Each test script is a separate Python program, usually placed in the ``t``
directory.

Running tests
-------------

The test scripts run with :mod:`Pyjo.Prove`: ::

    $ python -m Pyjo.Prove -I . -r t

or with Perl's ``prove``, as they print standard TAP: ::

    $ PYTHONPATH=. prove --ext=py --exec=python -r t

pytest runs them too, each script as a test of pytest, through
:mod:`Pyjo.Test.pytest_plugin`.

A single script runs on its own as well: ::

    $ PYTHONPATH=. python t/Pyjo/URL.py

Plans
-----

A test script declares how many tests it runs, either up front with
:func:`plan` or at the end with :func:`done_testing`. A script that runs tests
without a plan fails.

:func:`plan` is a context manager too, which issues the plan at the end of its
block, as :func:`done_testing` does, unless the block raises an exception: ::

    with plan():
        ok(True, 'first')
        ok(True, 'second')

Subtests
--------

A subtest groups tests under a name. Its tests are numbered on their own and
printed indented, and the subtest as a whole counts as one test of its parent,
which passes when all of its tests pass. :func:`subtest` works as a context
manager, as a decorator which runs the function at once, and as a function
which runs a callback: ::

    with subtest('Simple'):
        ok(True, 'first')

    @subtest('Decorated')
    def _():
        ok(True, 'second')

    subtest('Callback', lambda: ok(True, 'third'))

A subtest has an implicit :func:`done_testing`. ``plan(skip_all=...)`` skips
the rest of the subtest, and a subtest that runs no tests fails.

Chains
------

The functions which test a value return a :class:`Result`, which is true
when the test passed, so that ``if not is_ok(...):`` works, and whose
methods test the same value again, with the names of Perl's ``Test::More``,
so that the tests of a value chain as the assertions of
:mod:`Pyjo.Test.Pyjo` do: ::

    is_ok(url.host, 'example.com', 'right host').like(r'\.com$', 'top-level domain')

:func:`that` makes one of a value without a test, so that a chain starts
with the first of its methods: ::

    (
        that(answer)
        .isa(int)
        .cmp('>', 0, 'positive')
        .is_(42, 'meaning of life')
    )

Each method is a test of its own, which runs also after a test of the chain
failed, and a failure shows the line of the method.

Extensions
----------

A failed test shows the line of the first frame outside of :mod:`Pyjo.Test`
and of the modules that leave their frames out of the traceback of pytest
with ``__tracebackhide__``, so that the assertions of a module of their own,
as a subclass of :mod:`Pyjo.Test.Pyjo`, show the line of the test that calls
them: ::

    # MyTest.py
    import Pyjo.Test

    __tracebackhide__ = Pyjo.Test.__tracebackhide__


    def host_is(url, host, desc=None):
        return Pyjo.Test.is_ok(url.host, host, desc or f'host is {host}')

Exit status
-----------

The exit status of a test script is ``0`` when every test passed, the number of
failed tests (up to 254), ``254`` when tests ran without a plan, and ``255``
when the number of tests does not match the plan, when the script died with an
exception, or after :func:`bail_out`.

Exceptions
----------

After :func:`raise_failures`, the functions do not print TAP, so that they
work in the tests of another test runner, as pytest or unittest, where
:mod:`Pyjo.Test.pytest_plugin` calls it. A failed test raises
:exc:`AssertionError` with the name of the test and the diagnostic message,
``plan(skip_all=...)`` raises :exc:`unittest.SkipTest`, which both runners
report as a skipped test, or in a subtest leaves the subtest, and
:func:`bail_out` raises :exc:`BailOut`. A subtest is a block, the plans are
not checked, :func:`skip` does nothing, and :func:`diag` and :func:`note`
print their messages, which the runner captures. ::

    import unittest

    import Pyjo.Test
    import Pyjo.URL


    def setUpModule():
        Pyjo.Test.raise_failures()


    def tearDownModule():

    class TestURL(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_host(self):
            url = Pyjo.URL.new('HtTp://Example.Com')
            Pyjo.Test.is_ok(url.host, 'Example.Com', 'right host')
