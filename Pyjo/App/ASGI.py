Pyjo.App.ASGI - ASGI application

    async def hello(scope, receive, send):
        await send({'type': 'http.response.start', 'status': 200, 'headers': [(b'content-type', b'text/plain')]})
        await send({'type': 'http.response.body', 'body': b'Hello World!'})


    app = ASGI(app=hello)

    # Or import the module, as in Google Python Style Guide

    import Pyjo.App.ASGI

    app = Pyjo.App.ASGI.new(app=hello)

    # Mount it in an application of Pyjoyment
    import Pyjoyment

    pyjoyment = Pyjoyment.new()
    pyjoyment.plugin('Mount', {'/hello': app})

:mod:`Pyjo.App.ASGI` is an application of :mod:`Pyjo` that runs an ``ASGI``
application, as https://asgi.readthedocs.io describes it, so that a server of
:mod:`Pyjo` serves it, a route of :mod:`Pyjoyment` embeds it, as
:mod:`Pyjoyment.Plugin.Mount` does, and :mod:`Pyjo.Test.Pyjo` tests it.

The part of the path that a route embeds the application under is
``root_path``, after the base path of the request, and ``path`` is the whole
path, with ``root_path`` in front of it. A route that embeds the application
at a part of the path that does not end with a slash, as ``/php`` of
``/phpx``, which ``root_path`` cannot be, does not find it. The body of the request is the
message ``http.request`` of ``receive``, in chunks with ``more_body``, and
the next ``receive`` waits for the end of the connection, the message
``http.disconnect``.

The application runs as a coroutine of the reactor, as
:meth:`Pyjo.Reactor.Pyjo_Reactor.run_coroutine` runs it: with
:mod:`Pyjo.Reactor.Asyncio`, a task of the event loop of :mod:`asyncio`,
where it can await anything of the loop, and with another reactor, as
:mod:`Pyjo.Reactor.Poll`, a coroutine that awaits only ``receive`` and
``send``, so that an application that awaits anything else fails there. A
response that the application gives in one message ``http.response.body`` is
written with its ``Content-Length``. Another one is written as the application
sends it, with the chunked transfer encoding when the application does not
give its ``Content-Length``, and ``send`` returns once the chunk has been
written, so that a stream of server-sent events goes at the pace of the
client. Once the connection is gone, ``send`` does nothing.

An exception of the application before its response starts is a response
``500``, the exception page of :mod:`Pyjoyment` in a route that embeds it, an
exception after that is logged and closes the connection, as does an
application that returns before the end of its response, and an exception
after the end of the response is logged.

A WebSocket handshake is the connection ``websocket``, whose
``subprotocols`` are the ones that the client offers. The response of the
handshake waits for the message ``websocket.accept``, whose ``subprotocol``
and ``headers`` are those of the response ``101``, and a ``websocket.close``
before it rejects the handshake with the response ``403``, as does a response
of the application with the extension ``websocket.http.response``. The
messages of the WebSocket are ``websocket.receive``, and ``send`` of
``websocket.send`` returns once the message has been written. The end of the
WebSocket, also of a connection that is gone before the response of its
handshake, is the message ``websocket.disconnect`` with the status of the
close, after which ``send`` does nothing. An exception of the application, or
its return, before the response of the handshake is a response ``500``, and
after it is logged and closes the WebSocket with the status ``1011``, unless
the application has closed it.

The WebSockets are pinged, as by an ``ASGI`` server, with
:meth:`Pyjo.Transaction.WebSocket.Pyjo_Transaction_WebSocket.heartbeat` and
the intervals of :attr:`ping_interval` and :attr:`ping_timeout`, so that the
inactivity timeout of the server does not close a WebSocket without messages,
and a client that is gone is found.

The lifespan of the application, the connection ``lifespan``, starts with
the first request in each event loop, as of each process of
:mod:`Pyjo.Server.Prefork` and each thread of :mod:`Pyjo.Server.Prethread`,
or with :meth:`startup`, and the requests wait for its
``lifespan.startup.complete``, after which each gets a copy of its ``state``.
A ``lifespan.startup.failed`` is logged, and the requests get the response
``500``. An application that fails or returns before its startup has no
lifespan, as uvicorn takes it, and one that neither answers nor fails keeps
the requests waiting. The lifespan shuts down once the server has stopped
gracefully, with :meth:`server_stopped`, which
:mod:`Pyjoyment.Plugin.Mount` calls with the hook ``after_server_stop``,
with :meth:`close`, as at the end of a ``with`` block, and at the end of the
interpreter, where nothing has shut it down.

Attributes
----------

:mod:`Pyjo.App.ASGI` inherits all attributes from :mod:`Pyjo.App` and
implements the following new ones.

See also
--------

:mod:`Pyjoyment`, :mod:`Pyjoyment.Plugin.Mount`, :mod:`Pyjo.App.WSGI`,
:mod:`Pyjo.Server.ASGI`, https://mojolicious.org.

It has no counterpart in Mojolicious; it is the reverse of
:mod:`Pyjo.Server.ASGI`.
