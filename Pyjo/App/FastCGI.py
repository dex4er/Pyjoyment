Pyjo.App.FastCGI - FastCGI application
======================================
::

    from Pyjo.App.FastCGI import FastCGI

    app = FastCGI(url='fcgi://127.0.0.1:9000')

    # Or import the module, as in Google Python Style Guide

    import Pyjo.App.FastCGI

    app = Pyjo.App.FastCGI.new(url='fcgi://127.0.0.1:9000')

    # PHP on php-fpm, on a UNIX domain socket, with its script
    app = Pyjo.App.FastCGI.new(
        url='fcgi+unix://%2Frun%2Fphp%2Ffpm.sock',
        env={'SCRIPT_FILENAME': '/var/www/index.php', 'DOCUMENT_ROOT': '/var/www'},
    )

    # Mount it in an application of Pyjoyment
    import Pyjoyment

    pyjoyment = Pyjoyment.new()
    pyjoyment.plugin('Mount', {'/php': app})
    pyjoyment.plugin('Mount', {'/fcgi': 'fcgi://127.0.0.1:9000'})

:mod:`Pyjo.App.FastCGI` is an application of :mod:`Pyjo` that runs a
``FastCGI`` application, as php-fpm runs PHP, through a connection to it, as
a client of `FastCGI 1.0
<https://fastcgi-archives.github.io/FastCGI_Specification.html>`_ in the role
of a responder, so that a server of :mod:`Pyjo` serves it, a route of
:mod:`Pyjoyment` embeds it, as :mod:`Pyjoyment.Plugin.Mount` does, and
:mod:`Pyjo.Test.Pyjo` tests it.

The parameters of the request are its environment of ``CGI``: the part of the
path that a route embeds the application under is ``SCRIPT_NAME``, after the
base path of the request, which a part of the path that does not end with a
slash, as ``/php`` of ``/phpx``, cannot be, so that the application is not
found there, the rest of the path is ``PATH_INFO``, ``/`` for
the path of the mount itself, as an empty one is the whole path in
``SCRIPT_NAME`` for a server of ``FastCGI``, ``REQUEST_URI`` is the path with
the query, without the header ``Proxy``, whose ``HTTP_PROXY`` an application
may take for the proxy of its own requests, as with httpoxy, and :attr:`env`
adds to them, as ``SCRIPT_FILENAME`` for php-fpm, which :attr:`document_root`
gives for each request otherwise. The body of the request goes in records
``STDIN``, each once the one before has been written.

The connection is one for each request, through the event loop, which the
application closes after the response, or with :attr:`max_connections`, which
it keeps open, kept for the next request of the same event loop. A response of
``CGI`` that comes whole, with the end of the request, is written with its
``Content-Length``. Another one is written as it comes, each chunk once the
one before has been written to the client, with the chunked transfer encoding
when it does not give its ``Content-Length``. What the application writes to
its standard error is logged.

A connection that fails or closes before the response is a response ``502``,
and one that closes after the start of the response closes the connection of
the client, as one that is quiet for longer than :attr:`inactivity_timeout`
does, which, until the response starts, the connection of the client waits
for without the inactivity timeout of the server.

Attributes
----------

:mod:`Pyjo.App.FastCGI` inherits all attributes from :mod:`Pyjo.App` and
implements the following new ones.

See also
--------

:mod:`Pyjoyment`, :mod:`Pyjoyment.Plugin.Mount`, :mod:`Pyjo.App.WSGI`,
:mod:`Pyjo.Server.FastCGI`, https://mojolicious.org.

It has no counterpart in Mojolicious; it is the reverse of
:mod:`Pyjo.Server.FastCGI`.
