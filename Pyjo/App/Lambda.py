Pyjo.App.Lambda - AWS Lambda event function
===========================================
::

    from Pyjo.App.Lambda import Lambda

    app = Lambda(function='myfunction.handler')

    # Or import the module, as in Google Python Style Guide

    import Pyjo.App.Lambda

    app = Pyjo.App.Lambda.new(function='myfunction.handler')

    # Another runtime, with the events of a REST API
    app = Pyjo.App.Lambda.new(command=['node', 'runtime.js'], payload='1.0')

    # Mount it in an application of Pyjoyment
    import Pyjoyment

    pyjoyment = Pyjoyment.new()
    pyjoyment.plugin('Mount', {'/function': app})

:mod:`Pyjo.App.Lambda` is an application of :mod:`Pyjo` that runs an event
function of `AWS Lambda <https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/>`_, so that a server
of :mod:`Pyjo` serves it, a route of :mod:`Pyjoyment` embeds it, as
:mod:`Pyjoyment.Plugin.Mount` does, and :mod:`Pyjo.Test.Pyjo` tests it, as
API Gateway, a Function URL or an Application Load Balancer runs it on AWS.

The function runs in a process of its own, as an execution environment of
Lambda does, which :mod:`Pyjo.IOLoop.ChildProcess` starts on the first
request and keeps for the next ones, which it gets one after another. Each
event loop has a process of its own, and the child of a fork, as a worker of
:mod:`Pyjo.Server.Prefork`, leaves the processes of its parent to it and
starts its own. The process gets its invocations from the `Runtime API
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-api.html>`_ of
``AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API``, which a :mod:`Pyjo.Server.Daemon` on a port of
the loopback serves on the same event loop, so that a handler of Python runs
with the runtime client of :mod:`Pyjo.Server.Lambda`, also one that runs an
event loop of its own, and a function of another runtime with its own runtime
client, without the event loop waiting for it.

The request is the event of the payload format of :attr:`payload`, as
:mod:`Pyjo.Server.Lambda` takes it, and the path that a route embeds the
application under is the stage of API Gateway, in front of the path, which
:mod:`Pyjo.Server.Lambda` takes for the base path of the URL. A body that is
not text, JSON, XML, JavaScript or YAML in UTF-8 is in Base64. The response is
the one of the payload format, with its ``statusCode``, its headers, its
cookies and its body, which can be in Base64, and in the format ``2.0`` a
value without ``statusCode`` is a response ``200`` of the value as JSON, as API
Gateway takes it.

A streaming response of the runtime client, as the one of
:mod:`Pyjo.Server.Lambda` with the invoke mode ``RESPONSE_STREAM``, is
written as it comes, as a Function URL with the invoke mode
``RESPONSE_STREAM`` writes it: the status and the headers of its prelude, in
the content type ``application/vnd.awslambda.http-integration-response``,
before 8 null bytes, or ``200`` and the content type of the response, and its
body in chunks. The timeout of the function goes on until its end, and an
error in its trailers, or the timeout, in the middle of it closes the
connection, as the response cannot change anymore. ::

    # The streaming responses of an application on Pyjo.Server.Lambda
    app = Pyjo.App.Lambda.new(function='myapp.handler', env={'PYJO_LAMBDA_INVOKE_MODE': 'RESPONSE_STREAM'})

An error of the function or of its initialization, a response that is not
valid, a process that ends before its response, and an invocation that takes
longer than :attr:`timeout`, whose process is killed, as Lambda does, are a
response ``502``, logged, and the next request starts a new process. The
output of the process is logged, as Lambda sends it to CloudWatch. The event
loop does not watch pipes on Windows, so the response is ``502`` there.

Attributes
----------

:mod:`Pyjo.App.Lambda` inherits all attributes from :mod:`Pyjo.App` and
implements the following new ones.

See also
--------

:mod:`Pyjoyment`, :mod:`Pyjoyment.Plugin.Mount`, :mod:`Pyjo.Server.Lambda`,
:mod:`Pyjo.App.CGI`, https://mojolicious.org.

It has no counterpart in Mojolicious; it is the reverse of
:mod:`Pyjo.Server.Lambda`.
