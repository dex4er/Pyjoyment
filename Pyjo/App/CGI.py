Pyjo.App.CGI - CGI application
==============================
::

    from Pyjo.App.CGI import CGI

    app = CGI(script='/usr/lib/cgi-bin/hello.cgi')

    # Or import the module, as in Google Python Style Guide

    import Pyjo.App.CGI

    app = Pyjo.App.CGI.new(script='/usr/lib/cgi-bin/hello.cgi')

    # The programs of a directory, as cgi-bin
    app = Pyjo.App.CGI.new(document_root='/usr/lib/cgi-bin')

    # PHP on php-cgi, with the files of its directory
    app = Pyjo.App.CGI.new(
        command=['php-cgi'], document_root='/var/www', script_extensions=['.php'], static=True
    )

    # Mount it in an application of Pyjoyment
    import Pyjoyment

    pyjoyment = Pyjoyment.new()
    pyjoyment.plugin('Mount', {'/cgi-bin': app})

:mod:`Pyjo.App.CGI` is an application of :mod:`Pyjo` that runs a ``CGI``
program, as :rfc:`3875` describes it, in a process of its own for each
request, which :mod:`Pyjo.IOLoop.ChildProcess` runs, so that a server of :mod:`Pyjo` serves it, a route of
:mod:`Pyjoyment` embeds it, as :mod:`Pyjoyment.Plugin.Mount` does, and
:mod:`Pyjo.Test.Pyjo` tests it.

The environment of the process is the one of ``CGI`` of the request: the part
of the path that a route embeds the application under is ``SCRIPT_NAME``, after
the base path of the request, which a part of the path that does not end with
a slash, as ``/cgi`` of ``/cgix``, cannot be, so that the application is not
found there, the rest of the path is ``PATH_INFO``, ``REQUEST_URI`` is the path
with the query, without the header ``Proxy``, whose ``HTTP_PROXY`` a program
may take for the proxy of its own requests, as with httpoxy, with ``PATH`` of
the process of Pyjoyment, and :attr:`env` adds to them. The program runs in
the directory of its file, and the body of the request goes to its standard
input, each chunk once the one before has been written.

The standard output of the program is its response of ``CGI``, read through
the event loop, as it comes. A response that comes whole, before the program
closes its standard output, is written with its ``Content-Length``. Another one
is written as it comes, each chunk once the one before has been written to the
client, with the chunked transfer encoding when it does not give its
``Content-Length``. What the program writes to its standard error is logged.

A program that does not start or ends before its response is a response
``502``, and one that ends otherwise after the start of the response closes
the connection of the client, as one that is quiet for longer than
:attr:`inactivity_timeout` does, which, until the response starts, the
connection of the client waits for without the inactivity timeout of the
server. The process of a request whose client is gone is killed, with the
processes that it has started, as it runs as the leader of a process group.

The reactor watches the pipes of the process, which it can on POSIX systems,
not on Windows, where the response is ``502``.

Attributes
----------

:mod:`Pyjo.App.CGI` inherits all attributes from :mod:`Pyjo.App` and
implements the following new ones.

See also
--------

:mod:`Pyjoyment`, :mod:`Pyjoyment.Plugin.Mount`, :mod:`Pyjo.App.FastCGI`,
:mod:`Pyjo.IOLoop.ChildProcess`, :mod:`Pyjo.Server.CGI`, https://mojolicious.org.

It has no counterpart in Mojolicious; it is the reverse of
:mod:`Pyjo.Server.CGI`, inspired by ``Mojolicious::Plugin::CGI`` of CPAN.
