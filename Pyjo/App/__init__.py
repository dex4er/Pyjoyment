:mod:`Pyjo.App` is the base class of applications of :mod:`Pyjo`, a flexible
runtime environment for real-time web frameworks, with all the basic tools and
helpers needed to write simple web applications and higher level web
frameworks, such as :mod:`Pyjoyment`.

The end of a ``with`` block closes the connections and the servers of its
:attr:`~Pyjo_App.ua`.
