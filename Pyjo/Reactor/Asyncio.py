:mod:`Pyjo.Reactor.Asyncio` is a low-level event reactor based on
:mod:`asyncio`. It watches handles and runs timers in an asyncio event loop,
so coroutines, tasks and other users of the loop run along with it.

A reactor uses the event loop it is given, or else the loop that is running,
as inside :func:`asyncio.run`, or a new event loop of its own, and moves its
handles and timers to the loop that is running. In a loop that runs
already, :meth:`start` and :meth:`one_tick` return right away, as asyncio
does not nest event loops, and the handles and timers are watched by that
loop.

The loop watches handles with ``add_reader`` and ``add_writer``, which the
default event loop of asyncio on Windows, :class:`asyncio.ProactorEventLoop`,
does not have. There, a loop of its own is an
:class:`asyncio.SelectorEventLoop`, and a loop that the reactor is given or
that is running has to be one too, as of
``asyncio.run(main(), loop_factory=asyncio.SelectorEventLoop)``. The
:class:`asyncio.SelectorEventLoop` of Windows watches sockets only, not pipes
or files, up to 512 of them, with :func:`select.select`.

The end of a ``with`` block closes the event loop that the reactor made.
