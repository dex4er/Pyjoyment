:mod:`Pyjo.Reactor` is an abstract base class for low-level event reactors,
like :mod:`Pyjo.Reactor.Asyncio`.

Events
------

:mod:`Pyjo.Reactor` inherits all events from :mod:`Pyjo.EventEmitter` and can
emit the following new ones.

error
~~~~~
::

    reactor.on('error', lambda reactor, err: ...)

Emitted for exceptions caught in callbacks, fatal if unhandled. Note that if
this event is unhandled or fails it might kill your program, so you need to be
careful. ::

    reactor.on('error', lambda reactor, err: print(f'Something very bad happened: {err}'))

Alternative reactors
--------------------

:mod:`Pyjo.Reactor` is a namespace that other distributions can add reactors
to, and the ``PYJO_REACTOR`` environment variable selects one for
:mod:`Pyjo.IOLoop`. A reactor on another implementation of the asyncio event
loop, like uvloop, is a subclass of :mod:`Pyjo.Reactor.Asyncio`, and one on
an event loop that is not asyncio's, like the ones of Trio or gevent,
implements the methods of :mod:`Pyjo.Reactor`.

A reactor is a module named ``Pyjo.Reactor.<Name>``, with a function ``new``
that constructs it and the class as ``object``, as the modules of Pyjoyment
have them. ::

    # Pyjo/Reactor/MyLoop.py of another distribution
    import Pyjo.Reactor.Asyncio

    import asyncio
    import selectors

    class Pyjo_Reactor_MyLoop(Pyjo.Reactor.Asyncio.object):
        def __init__(self, loop=None):
            super().__init__(loop=loop or asyncio.SelectorEventLoop(selectors.SelectSelector()))

    new = Pyjo_Reactor_MyLoop.new
    object = Pyjo_Reactor_MyLoop

The distribution contains the module and no ``__init__.py`` of ``Pyjo`` or
``Pyjo.Reactor``: those of Pyjoyment have the base class and keep the
namespace open with :func:`pkgutil.extend_path`, and another one would
replace them when both are installed in the same directory. Its package
depends on Pyjoyment and holds only the files of its own reactor::

    Pyjo/
        Reactor/
            MyLoop.py

The reactor is found when the distribution is installed next to Pyjoyment or
in another directory of :data:`sys.path`, and the environment variable
selects it::

    PYJO_REACTOR=Pyjo.Reactor.MyLoop
