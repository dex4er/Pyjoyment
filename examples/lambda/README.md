# An event function of AWS Lambda

`function/app.py` is an application of `Pyjoyment.Lite` that runs as an event
function of AWS Lambda on the runtime of Python, which the OpenTofu of this
directory deploys, with the ZIP files of `generate lambda-zip --runtime`: the
function with `app.py` and `phpinfo.php`, and Pyjoyment in a layer of its own,
with a Function URL, and behind an Application Load Balancer on request.

The application is the directory `function`, as the generator puts every file
of the current directory into `function.zip`, which would take the state of
OpenTofu too. The inline metadata of the script takes Pyjoyment of the
checkout.

## Running locally

The same script runs as an application of its own:

```sh
uv run python examples/lambda/function/app.py daemon
```

and as an event function, with the events of Lambda, under `Pyjo.App.Lambda`,
as its test does:

```sh
uv run python -m Pyjo.Prove -l t/examples/lambda/app.py
```

## Deploying to AWS

The ZIP files go to `function/dist`, for the runtime of the variable
`runtime`, `python3.15` by default, and the architecture of the function,
`arm64`:

```sh
uv run --directory examples/lambda/function python app.py generate lambda-zip --arch arm64 --runtime python3.15
```

OpenTofu 1.13 deploys them with the credentials and the region of the default
chain of AWS, as `AWS_PROFILE` and `AWS_REGION`, and a new build of the same
files changes nothing:

```sh
tofu -chdir=examples/lambda init
tofu -chdir=examples/lambda apply
```

`-var pyjoyment_layer=ARN` takes a layer of Pyjoyment that is published
already, for the same Python, in the place of `function/dist/pyjoyment.zip`.

The output `url` is the Function URL, which the test takes in
`TEST_LAMBDA_URL`:

```sh
TEST_LAMBDA_URL=$(tofu -chdir=examples/lambda output -raw url) \
  uv run python -m Pyjo.Prove -l t/examples/lambda/app.py
```

`-var alb=true` puts the function behind an Application Load Balancer in the
default VPC too, which costs for each hour it runs, where the Function URL
costs nothing while it waits. Its URL is the output `alb_url`, which the test
takes in `TEST_LAMBDA_ALB_URL`:

```sh
tofu -chdir=examples/lambda apply -var alb=true
TEST_LAMBDA_ALB_URL=$(tofu -chdir=examples/lambda output -raw alb_url) \
  uv run python -m Pyjo.Prove -l t/examples/lambda/app.py
```

The resources go away with:

```sh
tofu -chdir=examples/lambda destroy
```

## PHP

The function runs what Pyjoyment mounts, also PHP on php-fpm. The layer of PHP
of [Bref](https://bref.sh) has it, and `app.py` starts it with the execution
environment and serves `phpinfo.php` under `/php` with `Pyjo.App.FastCGI`. The
variable `layers` adds the layer, which is in its default, commented out, or
in a `terraform.tfvars` of this directory, which git ignores:

```hcl
layers = [
  "arn:aws:lambda:eu-central-1:873528684822:layer:arm-php-85:21",
]
```

Locally, `PHP_FPM` names the php-fpm to start:

```sh
PHP_FPM=$(command -v php-fpm) uv run python examples/lambda/function/app.py daemon
```
