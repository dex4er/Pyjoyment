# Smoke test of the images of Pyjoyment: runs the script of a variant, which
# generates an application, builds its image with the wheel of the checkout,
# runs it and checks it. The only entry point of the workflow Docker Smoke
# Test.

# Usage: tt/docker-smoke/smoke.sh app|lite|lite-pep723|lambda|lambda-stream|lambda-image|lambda-zip|fastcgi|kubernetes
#
#   app           generate app, run as python -m MyApp, with --user app
#   lite          generate lite-app, with generate pyproject
#   lite-pep723   generate lite-app, with the inline metadata of PEP 723
#   lambda        generate lite-app, with handler = app.start(), on AWS Lambda
#   lambda-stream the same, streaming its responses, with the runtime client of
#                 Pyjo.Server.Lambda
#   lambda-image  generate lite-app, in an image of generate dockerfile --target
#                 lambda, as its own runtime, under the emulator of the Runtime
#                 API
#   lambda-zip    generate lite-app, in the ZIP files of generate lambda-zip, on
#                 the custom runtime provided.al2023, under the emulator of the
#                 Runtime API
#   fastcgi       generate lite-app, listening for FastCGI, behind Caddy
#   kubernetes    generate lite-app, in the manifests of generate kubernetes,
#                 dev with a ConfigMap, dev with --host-path and prod, on a
#                 cluster of kind of its own
#
# It needs docker, python and uv on PATH, as "mise exec --" gives them, and
# kind and kubectl for the variant kubernetes.
