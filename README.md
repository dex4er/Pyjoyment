A real-time web framework for the Python programming language, ported from
[Mojolicious](https://mojolicious.org), the real-time web framework for Perl.
Pyjoyment keeps the API of Mojolicious with Python names, so its documentation
and experience carry over.

The `Pyjo` package is the web development toolkit, ported from the `Mojo`
modules, which can be used for all kinds of applications independently of the
web framework:

- HTTP and WebSocket client and server.
- Non-blocking I/O web server, which also speaks FastCGI and runs as an ASGI,
  WSGI or CGI application, or as an event function of AWS Lambda.
- HTML/XML parser with CSS selector support.
- JSON with JSON Pointers, YAML and TOML, all loaded and dumped.
- Command line options with `Pyjo.GetOpt`, in the way of Getopt::Long,
  argparse and Cobra, also from environment variables.
- Python-ish templates and template strings, with automatic escaping.
- Containers for URLs, paths, query strings, headers, cookies and HTTP
  messages.
- Event emitter, event loop with TCP, UDP and UNIX domain sockets, logger
  and utility functions.
- Test scripts which print the [Test Anything Protocol](https://testanything.org/)
  (TAP), with `Pyjo.Test`, inspired by Perl's `Test::More`, and a test
  harness, `Pyjo.Prove`, inspired by Perl's `prove`.

The `Pyjoyment` package is the web framework itself: routes, controllers,
renderer, plugins, `Pyjoyment.Lite` and the command line interface. It
renders JSON, YAML and TOML, and reads its configuration from Python, JSON,
YAML and TOML files.

It mounts the applications of other Python frameworks under a path or a
host, next to its own routes, in the same process and on the same server:
WSGI applications, as those of Flask, and ASGI applications, as those of
Starlette, whose responses stream at the pace of the client.

Both are cloud native: `generate dockerfile` writes the image of an
application, whose server stops gracefully on the `TERM` of its container
and listens on the port of `PORT`, as Knative, Cloud Run, Render, Koyeb and
Heroku set it, and an application runs as an event function of AWS Lambda
too.

Pyjoyment requires Python 3.12 or newer and runs on PyPy on a best-effort
basis. It needs nothing besides the Python standard library.

## Status

Pyjoyment was written against Mojolicious 6 and is being revived as a port of
Mojolicious 9 to Python 3.12 and newer, with `asyncio` as its event loop.
The toolkit, the `Pyjo` package, is ported: URLs, DOM and CSS selectors,
JSON, templates, HTTP messages and cookies, the event loop with promises, the
user agent, and the servers, on their own, preforking, prethreading, with hot
deployment or reloading, and through FastCGI, ASGI, WSGI, CGI and AWS Lambda. So is the web framework, the
`Pyjoyment` package: routes, controllers, the renderer with templates and
template strings, plugins, `Pyjoyment.Lite` and the commands. The tests of
Mojolicious are ported with them, and a ported module names the Mojolicious
version it was ported from in its documentation.

Pyjoyment runs on Linux, macOS and Windows. On Windows, Python has no
`os.fork` and no UNIX domain sockets, so `Pyjo.Server.Prefork`,
`Pyjo.Server.Hot`, `Pyjo.Server.Reload` and `Pyjo.IOLoop.Subprocess` do not
run there, and `Pyjo.Server.Prethread` runs the workers in threads instead.
The event loop watches up to 512 sockets there, with the `select` of Windows,
and a server stops with Ctrl-C, gracefully, or with Ctrl-Break, immediately.

The progress is tracked in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dex4er/Pyjoyment/issues).

## Installation

Pyjoyment is installed from its Git repository, as the release on PyPI
predates the revival:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/dex4er/Pyjoyment
```

or, in a project managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```sh
uv add git+https://github.com/dex4er/Pyjoyment
```

## Quick start

These three lines are a whole web application.

```python
from Pyjoyment.Lite import *


get('/', {'text': 'I ♥ Pyjoyment!'})

app.start()
```

To run the example with the built-in development web server, just put the
code into a file and start it with `pyjo-reload`.

```console
$ pyjo-reload hello.py
Web application available at http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Test it with any HTTP client you prefer.

```console
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/
I ♥ Pyjoyment!
```

## Duct tape for the HTML5 web

Use all the latest Python and HTML features in beautiful single file
prototypes like this one, and grow them easily into well-structured
Model-View-Controller web applications with `pyjo generate app`.

```python
"""
__DATA__

@@ index.html.ep
% url = url_for('title')
<script>
  const ws = new WebSocket('<%= url.to_abs() %>');
  ws.onmessage = function (event) { document.body.innerHTML += event.data };
  ws.onopen    = function (event) { ws.send('https://mojolicious.org') };
</script>
"""

from Pyjoyment.Lite import *


# Render template "index.html.ep" from the DATA section
@get('/')
def index(c):
    c.render(template='index')


# WebSocket service used by the template to extract the title from a website
@websocket('/title')
def title(c):
    @c.on('message')
    def message(c, msg):
        c.ua().get_p(msg).then(lambda tx: c.send(tx.result.dom().at('title').text))


app.start()
```

The templates of a script of `Pyjoyment.Lite` are in its docstring, after a
line `__DATA__`, and the website is requested without blocking, as the
WebSocket service runs in the event loop.

## Servers

`Pyjo.HelloWorld` is the application that a server runs when it is given
none, and it answers every request with `Your Pyjo is working!`. It runs
natively on the web server of Pyjoyment:

```python
import Pyjo.HelloWorld
import Pyjo.Server.Daemon


Pyjo.Server.Daemon.new(app=Pyjo.HelloWorld.new(), listen=['http://*:3000']).run()
```

on [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/), an ASGI server
(`pip install uvicorn`):

```python
import Pyjo.HelloWorld
import Pyjo.Server.ASGI

import uvicorn


app = Pyjo.Server.ASGI.new(app=Pyjo.HelloWorld.new()).to_asgi_app()

uvicorn.run(app, port=3000)
```

or on [Werkzeug](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/), a WSGI server
(`pip install werkzeug`):

```python
import Pyjo.HelloWorld
import Pyjo.Server.WSGI

from werkzeug.serving import run_simple


app = Pyjo.Server.WSGI.new(app=Pyjo.HelloWorld.new()).to_wsgi_app()

run_simple('localhost', 3000, app)
```

and answers on port 3000:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/
```

On a platform that tells the server the port to listen on with the `PORT`
environment variable, as [Knative](https://knative.dev/),
[Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run), [Render](https://render.com/),
[Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), the
web server of Pyjoyment listens on that port, and `generate dockerfile`
writes the `Dockerfile` of the image of an application, with the port that
the image exposes:

```sh
./myapp.py generate dockerfile --port 8080
```

On [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), it is an event function,
whose handler `hello_world_lambda.handler` answers the events of API
Gateway, Function URLs and Application Load Balancers:

```python
import Pyjo.HelloWorld
import Pyjo.Server.Lambda


# The handler "hello_world_lambda.handler" of an event function of AWS Lambda
handler = Pyjo.Server.Lambda.new(app=Pyjo.HelloWorld.new()).to_lambda_app()
```

## Distributions

Pyjoyment needs nothing besides the Python standard library, so what needs
another library is a distribution of its own, which adds a module to a
namespace of Pyjoyment, as `Pyjo.Reactor` for a reactor or `Pyjoyment.Plugin`
for a plugin. They are installed from their Git repositories until they are
on PyPI.

- [Pyjo.Reactor.Twisted - Low-level event reactor with Twisted support](https://pyjoyment.readthedocs.io/projects/pyjo-reactor-twisted/en/latest/)

## Documentation

The documentation is on [Read the Docs](https://pyjoyment.readthedocs.io/).

## Examples

### Web scraping

```python
import Pyjo.UserAgent

from Pyjo.String.Unicode import u


# Extract named character references from HTML spec
tx = Pyjo.UserAgent.new().get('https://html.spec.whatwg.org')
for n in tx.res.dom('#named-character-references-table tbody > tr').each():
    u(n.at('td > code').text + ' ' + n.children('td')[1].text).trim().say()
```

### URL manipulation

```python
import Pyjo.URL


# 'ssh+git://git@github.com/dex4er/Pyjoyment.git'
url = Pyjo.URL.new('https://github.com/dex4er/Pyjoyment')
print(url.set(scheme='ssh+git', userinfo='git', path=f'{url.path}.git').to_unsafe_str())

# 'https://pypi.org/search/?q=Pyjoyment&o=&c=Programming+Language+%3A%3A+Python'
url = Pyjo.URL.new('https://pypi.org/search/')
print(url.set(query=[('q', 'Pyjoyment'), ('o', ''), ('c', 'Programming Language :: Python')]))
```
